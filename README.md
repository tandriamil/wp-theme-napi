Presentation
============
A simple and quite responsive theme for my [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) based blog.


Tools used
==========
I used the design framework [Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to get a responsive and clean design.

For the wallpaper pattern, I used a pattern which is in the public domain, you can get it [here](http://colrd.com/pattern/20401).

For the font here, i used a [SIL](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) licensed one, available [here](http://www.dafont.com/fr/comfortaa.font) and created by [Johan Aakerlund](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-50227.html)


Installation
============
You can build the theme by launching the `napi_build.sh` script. It will update the dependencies and compress the js and css files. They will be available at `js/napi.js` and `css/napi.css`.

After doing that, you'll only need to put the theme in the `wp-content/themes` directory.
